# Mantine Dokuwiki Template

The default Dokuwiki theme but modern and dark - you won't need sunglasses to use your wiki ðŸŒž.

# About

There's nothing wrong with the default theme, that's why this template stays true to that vision. Only the colours, icons, and controls have been altered the layout you know and love is *exactly* the same ðŸ¤©.

[Mantine UI](https://ui.mantine.dev/) has been used as a reference for styling and colours.

[Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) have been used to replace all existing icons with these beautiful line works.

## Plugin Integrations

The driving force for this template was to update the `WRAP` plugin boxes, the rest of the theme had to be made as a result. Here are the plugin integrations:
- `WRAP` : all boxes, and other class styles.

# Issues

There will most likely been styles that have been missed, everything that I could see I updated... even the admin pages ðŸ« .

Please raise any missed styles as issues on this repository, also include the steps for where to see the style as I've only dealt with normal use cases.

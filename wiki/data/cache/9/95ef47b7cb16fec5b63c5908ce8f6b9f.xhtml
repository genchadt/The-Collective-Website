<strong>Current Template</strong> <br/>

With this app you can create a style sheet for the CKEditor&#039;s editing window that is based on your template. It will place the style sheet in your template folder in the directory named <strong>Styles</strong>, which will be created when the style sheet is saved. The style sheet will be named <strong>_styles.css</strong>. To activate this style sheet two things must be done:
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> it must be placed in <strong>ckgedit/ckeditor/css</strong>. This will automatically be done for you if you check off the checkbox labeled <strong>Copy to ckeditor/css.</strong></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The <strong>style_sheet</strong>  option in the <code>Configuration Settings</code>  must be set to <strong>true</strong>.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Other templates: installed but not activated</strong> <br/>
You can also create additional style sheets for other templates which you might have stored in your <strong>tpl</strong>  folder. These will be copied to the Styles folder of the respective templates but not to <strong>ckeditor/css</strong>.

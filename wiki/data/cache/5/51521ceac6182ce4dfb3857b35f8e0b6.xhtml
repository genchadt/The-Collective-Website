The Scayt spellchecker offers three Configuration Options: on, off, disabled. As of now, the default setting will be <strong>off</strong> instead of <strong>on</strong>.  With <strong>on</strong> the contents of the editor is parsed by Scayt and sent for spell-checking to a Scayt server. While there is no reason to believe this is a security risk, nevertheless this change is being made out of consideration for users with private wikis who may feel anxious having their data sent to a remote server. When set to “disable” The spell checker is removed entirely.
